			"Good afternoon.",
			"Good day.",
			"Good evening.",
			"Good morning.",
			"Good to see you!",
			"Greetings.",
			"Hello.",
			"I have a quest for you.",
			"I have a reward for you!",
			"I have news for you.",
			"Stay a while and listen.",
			"Yes?",
			"You have returned!",
			"...I thank you, friend, for coming to my aid.",
			"Oh... Blessings on the Rogues! They finally rescued me from that cursed place!",
			"Regrettably, I could do nothing to prevent the disaster which devastated Tristram. It would appear that our greatest fears have come to pass. Diablo, the Lord of Terror, has once again been set loose upon the world!",
			"As you know, some time ago Diablo was slain beneath Tristram. And when our hero emerged triumphant from the labyrinth beneath town, we held a grand celebration that lasted several days.",
			"Yet, as the weeks passed, our hero became increasingly aloof. He kept his distance from the rest of the townsfolk and seemed to lapse into a dark, brooding depression. I thought that perhaps his ordeal had been so disturbing that he simply could not put it out of his mind.",
			"The hero seemed more tormented every passing day. I remember he awoke many times -- screaming in the night -- always something about 'the East'.",
			"One day, he simply left. And shortly thereafter Tristram was attacked by legions of foul demons. Many were slain, and the demons left me to die in that cursed cage.",
			"I believe now that Tristram's hero was that Dark Wanderer who passed this way before the Monastery fell.",
			"I fear even worse, my friend... I fear that Diablo has taken possession of the hero who sought to slay him. If true, Diablo will become more powerful than ever before.",
			"You must stop him or all will be lost.",
			"That tower marks a place of danger. There is an epic poem about it... How much sorrow one can stand was tested there.",
			"Quickly in and quickly out is all the advice I can give you.",
			"Well done, my friend. Courage and opportunity together have created in you a kind of alchemy.",
			"The Malus was forged and enchanted by the ancient Horadric Mages during the Sin Wars. When their union dissolved, the Malus was entrusted to the Sisterhood guarding the pass into the East.",
			"The Malus has eluded you so far. Well, search thoroughly in the Barracks... That is where the Rogues kept their forge.",
			"The magical effects imbued by the Malus are impossible to predict, but are always to the good.",
			"It is certain that we face the demon queen, Andariel, who has corrupted the Rogue Sisterhood and defiled their ancestral Monastery. This does not bode well for us, my friend.",
			"Ancient Horadric texts record that Andariel and the other Lesser Evils once overthrew the three Prime Evils -- Diablo, Mephisto and Baal -- banishing them from Hell to our world. Here, they caused mankind untold anguish and suffering before they were finally bound within the Soulstones.",
			"Andariel's presence here could mean that the forces of Hell are once again aligned behind Diablo and his Brothers. If this is true, then I fear for us all.",
			"You must kill her before the Monastery becomes a permanent outpost of Hell and the way east lost forever.",
			"Diablo is heading east for some foul purpose. And the only passage east is through the Monastery gate. Obviously, Diablo summoned Andariel to block any pursuit.",
			"For her part Andariel hopes to win Diablo's favor... the lesser demons are always vying for positions of power within the unholy hierarchy!",
			"It is clear that Andariel is acting on behalf of Diablo to prevent anyone from following him eastward. Her defeat would allow you to continue the pursuit.",
			"Ancient lore has it that while Andariel was spawned in the Burning Hells, she is not fond of fire.",
			"This is a great victory indeed, but many more battles await. I will accompany you on your journey, lending what assistance I can...",
			"Remember... Diablo is still out there, seeking something in the desert. I'm afraid that this nightmare will not end until you find what it is that he seeks.",
			"Long ago, the Soulstones were given to the Horadrim by the Archangel Tyrael. They were used to bind the three Prime Evils. I now know that even these holy artifacts were no match for Diablo's power.",
			"I hope that his two brothers are more securely held... but I fear the worst.",
			"It takes time to master your skills... and use will hone your technique. But take care to choose your new skills wisely.",
			"You may recover some mysterious things from the demons you kill. Some of great use to you... some of great peril! Bring them to me and I'll reveal their secrets.",
			"Have I told you about the Horadrim? They were an ancient confederation of mage-clans who sought to bind the three Prime Evils for eternity. The Horadrim are now nearly forgotten... and it appears that the bonds they wove are unravelling!",
			"As the last of the Horadrim, I pray that I can help you remedy their failure.",
			"Long ago, Diablo and his brothers were cast out of Hell by the Lesser Evils. It seems that Hell's balance has shifted, as Andariel is now aligned with the Lord of Terror. Her presence here in the mortal realm does not bode well for us.",
			"The Horadrim used to mummify their highest mages, and infuse them with spells that would allow them to protect their tombs, even after death.",
			"I have no idea why one of them would be acting so malevolently. Perhaps Drognan or Fara would know more about this.",
			"The Horadric mummies were created to protect the tombs, but Radament is far from his burial chamber. Given the aberrations that have been witnessed lately, it comes as no surprise that even the ancient guardian spells have begun to unravel. Be wary of this as you venture farther into the desert.",
			"If you haven't already, tell Atma that Radament is dead. It may help to ease the weight of her mourning.",
			"Ahh... The lost Horadric Scroll! What a fortunate turn of events...",
			"As the last living Horadrim, I alone have knowledge of its meaning. Now, to read the Horadric runes it bears. Hmmm...",
			"The Horadric Mages, after binding Baal within Tal Rasha, magically sealed off his Burial Chamber from the mortal realm. Those same Mages also crafted fearsome Horadric Staves and imbued them with the special power to open the Chamber's hidden door.",
			"After nearly losing one to the thievery of a rogue sorcerer, they divided all the Horadric Staves into two parts - wooden shaft and metal headpiece - hiding them separately to safeguard them.",
			"The Horadrim foresaw our current plight and designed the hiding places to reveal themselves to worthy heroes like you.",
			"Collect both parts of a Horadric Staff and unite them using a Horadric Cube. Then, you may enter Tal Rasha's Burial Chamber.",
			"You have quite a treasure there in that Horadric Cube. According to Horadric lore, the Cube can restore a Horadric Staff.",
			"To do it - use the Cube as you would a scroll. When the Cube opens, place both pieces of the Staff into it and use the Cube's transmute power.",
			"You'll be pleased to know that the Cube has other alchemical uses as well...",
			"Six gems plus one sword transmute into a socketed long sword.",
			"You may also transmute two quivers of crossbow bolts into one quiver of arrows, while two quivers of arrows yield one quiver of bolts.",
			"I must leave it to you to discover other formulae.",
			"The Staff of Kings! You astound me, my friend. You have discovered the shaft portion of a Horadric Staff.",
			"I trust you know how to use a Horadric Cube to unite the shaft with its headpiece.",
			"The Viper Amulet you bear is actually the headpiece of a Horadric Staff!",
			"Yes... You have an uncanny knack for finding rare and valuable artifacts. Of course, you'll have to use a Horadric Cube to combine the headpiece with the shaft.",
			"Excellent! You have a Horadric Staff.",
			"Carry it with you into Tal Rasha's Tomb. Find within the Tomb the chamber whose floor is inset with the Circle of Seven Symbols.",
			"Place the Staff into the receptacle you find there. That will open the secret passage into Tal Rasha's Burial Chamber.",
			"But, be prepared for a fight - you'll likely have to kill Tal Rasha to destroy Baal.",
			"Drognan may have some advice on this matter. Hmm... I think I'll speak with him myself.",
			"The source of this spell is probably a magical altar. It will not be enough to kill the Claw Vipers. To reverse the spell you must destroy the altar.",
			"I've been speaking with Lord Jerhyn, and I sense that he is becoming more and more agitated by something. You should try to talk to him again.",
			"If he still won't take you into his confidence, seek to prove yourself a bit more. I gather that his respect for you is growing.",
			"I very much doubt that Horazon still lives in his Sanctuary. He possessed great power and influence over demons, but even that may not have been enough in the end. One of his notoriety cannot easily remove himself from the vengeful reach of Hell.",
			"I've been thinking about the problems in Jerhyn's palace. Perhaps this has occurred to you as well...",
			"If those cellar passageways lead to the Arcane Sanctuary, then that is where the demons came from. Horazon's haven must have been breached!",
			"You must move quickly now, friend, for Diablo is undoubtedly close to finding what he seeks. Find the Tomb of Tal Rasha before he frees the Lord of Destruction.",
			"The appearance of the mage you describe sounds like one I met back in Tristram. Many Vizjerei came to fight against Diablo, the Lord of Terror. Perhaps, this is one of them.",
			"You know, fate seems to have frowned upon all of the heroes who confronted that terrible Evil. Take care or the same may happen to you.",
			"I hope that this false Summoner found peace in death. Unfortunately, it is more likely that he will be dragged down into Hell by the demons he was bound to.",
			"Let this be a lesson to you... Demonic magic is a quick path, but its powers are seductive and deadly.",
			"Diablo nears his goal. We have little time to lose.",
			"Remember, my friend, that Andariel gave herself willingly to Diablo's cause. It would be prudent to assume that the other Evils will attempt to aid their master as well.",
			"The Archangel Tyrael was the one who gave the Soulstones to the Horadrim two hundred and sixty years ago.",
			"It is highly unusual for the forces of Heaven to so directly interfere with man's destiny, but Tyrael was said to act of his own volition. We have never been able to discern why.",
			"Perhaps, he goes against the consensus of Heaven because he doubts our ability to defend ourselves, or perhaps, he sees more threat than his peers.",
			"Where the actions of Hell often seem straightforwardly bent on destruction, the motives of Heaven are unfathomable.",
			"Now make haste... Both Diablo and Baal must be stopped before they join with their brother, Mephisto. If the three Prime Evils unite once again, the world as we know it will be no more.",
			"Elzix is quite a scoundrel, but I like him all the same.",
			"There is something about Fara that troubles me. Her manner is strange for a lonely desert-maid.",
			"Greetings, my friend. Have you spoken to Jerhyn yet? He's quite a remarkable leader for being such a young man. Then again, the old blood has always run strong in this land.",
			"Meshif is an interesting man. Part of him longs for the freedom of the open seas... Yet his heart belongs in his homeland.",
			"I talked at length with Warriv as we crossed the desert from Khanduras. He has many fascinating tales of the dangers in the desert. His experience may be useful to you.",
			"I've not set foot in glorious Kurast for many years. But I never would have imagined it could be so corrupted.",
			"Certainly, this must be Mephisto's work! You'd best get going, my friend. Diablo and Baal are still out there and you must find them.",
			"Back in Lut Gholein Meshif told me he had a fondness for jade figurines. On his trading voyages he collected an odd assortment of such small statues.",
			"I would show him your figurine.",
			"I've read legends about a sage named Ku Y'leh, who studied the mysteries of life beyond death.",
			"If I remember correctly, his ashes were ensconced within a golden statuette. It was a very strange tale.",
			"So, Meshif had the Golden Bird all along. I wonder if he knows what he gave up for that jade figurine.",
			"I've done some research on the Taan mage-clan, and it seems that most of their magical studies were focused on Skatsimi rites.",
			"If anyone is qualified to use the powers of the Gidbinn, it would be Ormus.",
			"Since you haven't come across the Gidbinn yet, the dagger must be deeper in the jungle nearer Kurast.",
			"Who could have foreseen that the Old Religion would play such an effective role in our war against the Three? Again, your efforts amaze me, my friend.",
			"Never forget that your ultimate purpose here in Kurast is to destroy Mephisto. The ancient Horadrim imprisoned the Lord of Hatred inside the Guardian Tower that is located within the Temple City of Travincal.",
			"Know this, friend. The only way to gain entry to Mephisto's prison is to destroy the artifact known as the Compelling Orb.",
			"Mephisto used this device to control the Zakarum Priests and their followers. The Orb can only be destroyed with an ancient flail imbued with the spirit of the one incorruptible priest.",
			"Soon after his imprisonment, Mephisto worked his evil corruption on the Zakarum priesthood. All were turned to his dark ways, save one - Khalim, the Que-Hegan of the High Council.",
			"Mephisto directed the other Council priests to slay and dismember Khalim and then scatter his remains across the Kingdom. The Priest Sankekur succeeded Khalim as Que-Hegan, eventually becoming the embodiment of Mephisto here on the mortal plane.",
			"The corrupted High Council fashioned an Orb to control the rest of the Zakarum faithful and used their powers to hide the lair of their master from mortals.",
			"Your task is to collect the scattered relics of Khalim - his Heart, his Brain, and his Eye. Then, using the Horadric Cube, transmute Khalim's Flail with his relics.",
			"Once this is accomplished, you must destroy the Compelling Orb with Khalim's Will to open the way into the corrupt sanctum of Mephisto.",
			"Ahh... Khalim's Eye! Only it can reveal the true path to Mephisto.",
			"Place the Eye in the Horadric Cube along with Khalim's other relics - the Heart, the Brain, and the Flail.",
			"This is most fortunate! Khalim's Brain knows Mephisto's weakness.",
			"Place it in the Horadric Cube along with Khalim's other relics - the Eye, the Heart, and the Flail.",
			"You have found Khalim's Heart, and it still bears the courage to face Mephisto!",
			"Place it in the Horadric Cube along with Khalim's other relics - the Eye, the Brain, and the Flail.",
			"Once properly imbued, Khalim's Flail can destroy the Compelling Orb and reveal the way to Mephisto.",
			"Place it into the Horadric Cube along with Khalim's relics - his Heart, his Brain, and his Eye. Then, transmute them to carry out Khalim's Will.",
			"Masterfully done, hero! You have crafted Khalim's Will. Employ it to destroy the Compelling Orb and open the way to Mephisto.",
			"May the true Light guide your way.",
			"The Black Book is a powerful source of information. The Zakarum will do everything in their power to stop you from obtaining it.",
			"I heard that there are ruined temples in Kurast. Perhaps you will find the Black Book in one of them.",
			"You have found a source of information powerful enough to turn the tide against the Zakarum.",
			"Ormus tells me that the Council is comprised of tremendously powerful priests. It will be difficult to best them.",
			"The Temple City is well guarded. You'd best keep your wits about you.",
			"Sankekur may be using a Compelling Orb to control the minds of the Children of Zakarum.",
			"Ridding Kurast of the Council of Zakarum was essential. Still, there is more you must do. The Compelling Orb, too, must be destroyed.",
			"Diablo and Baal must be close to finding their brother, Mephisto, by now. You've no time to waste.",
			"You must reach Mephisto before his brothers do.",
			"The ancient Horadrim always feared that the Three would escape their prisons and unite. I can't believe that I, the last of their Order, have seen it come to pass.",
			"You are the only one who can prevent this, my friend. The final hour draws near.",
			"Search the Tower thoroughly. Mephisto must not escape.",
			"Our faith in you was well deserved. But Diablo has made his way to Hell; and it is likely that Baal followed him there.",
			"Enter the Infernal Gate and kill the Lord of Terror before all is lost. Only then will our world be saved!",
			"Asheara seems like a very tough woman. I'd be careful around her if I were you.",
			"Drognan told me of Hratli when we were in Lut Gholein. He said that he weaves magic into his forge and produces mystical weapons and armor.",
			"His skills could be quite useful to you.",
			"Seeing his homeland in such a state must be horrifying to Meshif. I'm surprised he's willing to remain here in order to help you.",
			"Have you met, Natalya? She appears to be a member of the Khral-Harzhek, a secret order that has been around for centuries... almost as long as the Horadrim, itself.",
			"Her presence here makes me uneasy, for they are traditionally sworn to hunt down Magi who have betrayed the trust of their order.",
			"I wonder why she is here.",
			"Judging from his dress and strange markings, I would guess that Ormus is from the ancient Taan mage-clan. Yet none of the others here seem to know that he is a sorcerer.",
			"The Taan were once as powerful as the Vizjerei clan, but their studies were even more secretive. I wonder what he's hiding.",
			"Ormus would like you to think him mad. Better to watch his actions than listen to his words.",
			"Hello, my friend. I was hoping you'd return. It gets very unnerving here...especially when I'm alone.",
			"Can you believe this place? Did you ever dare to dream that you'd one day stand upon the crossroads between Heaven and Hell? This Pandemonium Fortress is truly miraculous.",
			"However, your journey is not yet over. Diablo still roams free in Hell, marshalling his demonic forces. Only when he is beaten will our world finally have peace.",
			"Hurry now... the sands of time slow for no one!",
			"Tyrael has asked you to confront Izual the Fallen? He must have great faith in your abilities!",
			"I trust you know what you're doing... Be careful. You're our last hope.",
			"Having trouble finding the Fallen Angel, eh?",
			"You'd better hurry. It's beginning to feel like some great evil is permeating the air around here.",
			"You're lucky to be alive, my friend! It is imperative that you find and stop Diablo!",
			"You should speak of this with Tyrael. He will know what to make of this.",
			"The time has come for you to destroy Mephisto's Soulstone!",
			"Take the Stone to the Hellforge. Place it upon the forge and strike it soundly with the Hammer.",
			"Only by doing this can you prevent Mephisto from manifesting in this world ever again.",
			"The time has come to destroy Mephisto's Soulstone!",
			"Although I picked it up before entering the Infernal Gate, I believe you should carry out this crucial mission.",
			"Take the Stone to the Hellforge. Place it upon the forge and strike it soundly with the Hammer.",
			"Only by doing this can you prevent Mephisto from manifesting in this world ever again.",
			"Congratulations, hero!",
			"Surely, even Diablo, himself, sensed the fury unleashed when you smashed his Brother's Soulstone.",
			"You don't have time to dally about here!",
			"Diablo awaits you in Hell. Remember... Diablo's greatest weapon against you is Terror.",
			"Don't give in to your fears. Resist his power and put an end to him for good!",
			"I knew there was great potential in you, my friend. You've done a fantastic job.",
			"Though my ancestors often struggled against the Three Evils and their minions, I've always lived a shut-in, scholarly life. I'm glad that my wisdom aided you.",
			"Now, I wish to leave this place. Though Heaven's Gates are a marvel to behold, I hope I won't have to see them again for many, many years.",
			"Please talk to Tyrael about leaving this place now!",
			"I have read much about the enigmatic Archangel Tyrael. He was revered in Horadrim lore both for his compassion for mortals and his unquenchable spirit.",
			"It was rumored that he went against the wishes of Heaven and gave the Horadrim the original Soulstones in order to trap Diablo and his Brothers.",
			"I am amazed to find this place so untouched. Everything else in the path of Baal the Lord of Destruction lies in ruin.",
			"These Barbarians must indeed be the legendary guardians of Mount Arreat. They are a proud, hardy people. Don't expect to be greeted warmly -- strangers here rarely are.",
			"Perhaps I can gain their trust. I'll spend some time with the townsfolk and try to understand them better. I'll let you know what I discover.",
			"I believe that stopping the siege on Harrogath is the only way for you to earn the trust of these people.",
			"I understand your reluctance, but now is the time to strike.",
			"Those catapults were like nothing I have ever seen before. You have prevailed against Shenk, my friend, but Baal is still far ahead of you.",
			"I know firsthand that captivity is a sad fate for a man. Find them quickly.",
			"If you are having trouble finding Qual-Kehk's soldiers, you should talk to Malah. She healed those who made it back before. Perhaps she would have some advice.",
			"You've become a hero to this town, my friend. The shadows have lifted ever since you brought the Light to Harrogath.",
			"I would listen to Malah. Nihlathak speaks with a venomous tongue and acts as if the entire weight of this town rests upon his shoulders.",
			"Perhaps there is more going on here than we know.",
			"Nihlathak's story does sound reasonable, considering what I've heard about Anya. However, the best lies are often hidden within truth.",
			"Goodness! Anya frozen by that fallen Barbarian, Nihlathak...Perhaps Malah can help you where I cannot.",
			"For one so young, Anya commands great respect. Now that she is here, I will make it a point to talk to her about Mount Arreat.",
			"You should do the same.",
			"Regretfully, I know very little about this Relic. However, if what the others say is true, then Baal must not gain possession of it.",
			"Stop Nihlathak...before all is lost.",
			"Ohh...This is a truly horrible turn of events.",
			"I know it seems you have always been one step behind, my friend. But look at it this way...You have evil on the run.",
			"Beware! Baal grows stronger with every passing moment.",
			"A test of mettle is a fitting rite of passage for a Barbarian hero.",
			"We have come too far to be defeated now, my friend. I have seen you complete many difficult quests. Though this may be your greatest trial, it is not beyond your reach.",
			"You have proven yourself to these people. They look to you as their warrior, their champion.",
			"Remember this. Baal once possessed Tal Rasha, one of the most powerful of the ancient Horadrim.",
			"Your battles with Mephisto and Diablo will pale in comparison to your battle with Baal.",
			"The Lord of Destruction aided by Tal Rasha's knowledge...The mountain itself will tremble when you clash.",
			"I knew in time you would defeat Baal. You have done everything you set out to do, my friend.",
			"Ever since you rescued me from Tristram, I have believed in you. It has been a supreme honor to aid you along the way.",
			"So...The Worldstone was corrupted by Baal. And now Tyrael must destroy it. Worry not. Through whatever lies ahead I have faith that the Light will guide us both.",
			"Go, now, back to the Worldstone chamber, and enter the portal Tyrael has opened for you.",
			"With hellspawn, size is no measure of their threat. Demons half the size of men can kill with a gesture, while hellish pack animals trample any who stand in their way.",
			"Though these Barbarians are known throughout the kingdoms as ferocious fighters, they are also capable of great compassion.",
			"They have trained throughout history for a battle their legends foretell will decide the fate of the world.",
			"The angel Tyrael has watched over the guardians of Arreat throughout history. I do not believe that Baal and Tyrael have come to fight over a paltry few souls.",
			"They are here to settle a conflict as old as time itself.",
			"During my time with the Horadrim, we often debated the nature of Mount Arreat.",
			"We knew that the Barbarian clans zealously guarded the mountain as their sacred duty. However, many dismissed their zeal as simple superstition...combined with an inborn hostility toward outsiders.",
			"Those Horadrim who trekked up Arreat were never heard from again...Still, I do not believe they died at the hands of Barbarians.",
			"All users of the magical arts know of Mount Arreat, but few understand its true nature. It is the nexus of an unfathomable magic.",
			"It bodes ill that the Lord of Destruction races to its summit with such purpose. I fear for the whole world should Baal gain what he seeks.",
			"I have spent decades trying to understand the forces at work in this world. But in the face of all that is transpiring, I realize how meager my knowledge is.",
			"I will be of assistance where I can, my friend.",
			"Though the Elder Council of Harrogath is gone, there are many capable young leaders to take their place.",
			"Anya certainly has enough courage and intelligence to lead them all, if they can survive this catastrophe.",
			"It is my belief that the Soulstones are at the center of this conflict. If only that fool Marius had not intervened, Baal would still be imprisoned within Tal Rasha.",
			"Ah, Anya. Such a fine example of feminine strength...",
			"She reminds me of the Zakarum priestesses I knew in my youth. They don't take vows of chastity, you know.",
			"It is fortunate that this town has such a talented smith.",
			"The quality of Larzuk's work surely complements your skills. In fact, he would have been quite welcome amongst the Horadrim.",
		"While you are venturing deeper into the Labyrinth you may find tomes of great knowledge hidden there.",
		"Read them carefully for they can tell you things that even I cannot.",
		"I know of many myths and legends that may contain answers to questions that may arise in your journeys into the Labyrinth",
		"If you come across challenges and questions to which you seek knowledge, seek me out and I will tell you what I can.",
		"Griswold - a man of great action and great courage. I bet he never told you about the time he went into the Labyrinth to save Wirt, did he",
		"He knows his fair share of the dangers to be found there, but then again - so do you. He is a skilled craftsman, and if he claims to be able to help you in any way, you can count on his honesty and his skill.",
		"Ogden has owned and run the Rising Sun Inn and Tavern for almost four years now. He purchased it just a few short months before everything here went to hell",
		"He and his wife Garda do not have the money to leave as they invested all they had in making a life for themselves here. He is a good man with a deep sense of responsibility.",
		"Poor Farnham. He is a disquieting reminder of the doomed assembly that entered into the Cathedral with Lazarus on that dark day",
		"He escaped with his life, but his courage and much of his sanity were left in some dark pit. He finds comfort only at the bottom of his tankard nowadays, but there are occasional bits of truth buried within his constant ramblings.",
		"The witch, Adria, is an anomaly here in Tristram. She arrived shortly after the Cathedral was desecrated while most everyone else was fleeing",
		"She had a small hut constructed at the edge of town, seemingly overnight, and has access to many strange and arcane artifacts and tomes of knowledge that even I have never seen before.",
		"The story of Wirt is a frightening and tragic one. He was taken from the arms of his mother and dragged into the labyrinth by the small, foul demons that wield wicked spears. There were many other children taken that day, including the son of King Leoric. The Knights of the palace went below, but never returned. The Blacksmith found the boy, but only after the foul beasts had begun to torture him for their sadistic pleasures.",
		"Ah, Pepin. I count him as a true friend - perhaps the closest I have here. He is a bit addled at times, but never a more caring or considerate soul has existed. His knowledge and skills are equaled by few, and his door is always open.",
		"Gillian is a fine woman. Much adored for her high spirits and her quick laugh, she holds a special place in my heart. She stays on at the tavern to support her elderly grandmother who is too sick to travel. I sometimes fear for her safety, but I know that any man in the village would rather die than see her harmed."]

			"I thank you, mortal, for my freedom. But I did expect you earlier.",
			"I am the Archangel Tyrael. I came here to prevent Diablo from freeing his brother, Baal. But I have failed. Now, Terror and Destruction roam free throughout your world.",
			"Even now, they head towards the Eastern capital of Kurast - to the very heart of the Zakarum Temple. There they hope to find their eldest brother, Mephisto, the Lord of Hatred who was imprisoned there ages ago.",
			"If the three Prime Evils unite, they will be invincible. Though it is unclear as to what their aims are, it is certain that they must be stopped at all costs.",
			"I am broken and the energies that tie me to this world are diminishing rapidly.",
			"You must take up this quest and prevent the Three Brothers from reuniting. You must cross the sea and search for Diablo and Baal in Kurast.",

			"What do you need?",
			"Yes?",
			"Your presence honors me.",
			"It is good to see you again, hero.",
			"Mephisto's defeat is a great victory for the Light. I knew that you would eventually find your way here. The Pandemonium Fortress is the last bastion of Heaven's power before the Gates of the Burning Hells.",
			"This place has been hallowed by the blood of thousands of champions of the Light, many of whom were mortal, like yourself. Now the final battle against the Prime Evils draws near... and you must face it alone.",
			"I have been forbidden to aid you directly, save for a few bits of wisdom. For this is the hour of mortal Man's triumph...your triumph.",
			"May the Light protect you and the powers of Heaven shine upon your path...",
			"There is a dark, tortured soul who was trapped within this forsaken realm long ago. He was called Izual by mortal men, and in ages past he was my most trusted Lieutenant.",
			"Yet, against my wishes he led an ill-fated assault upon the fiery Hellforge, itself.",
			"Despite his valor and strength, Izual was captured by the Prime Evils and twisted by their perverse power. They forced him to betray his own kind and give up Heaven's most guarded secrets.",
			"He became a corrupt shadow of his former self - a fallen angel trusted neither by Heaven nor Hell.",
			"For his transgressions, Izual's spirit was bound within the form of a terrible creature which was summoned from the Abyss. His maddened spirit has resided within that tortured husk for many ages now.",
			"It seems to me that he has suffered long enough. I implore you, hero, find Izual and release him from his cruel imprisonment.",
			"Put an end to his guilt and suffering.",
			"Though Izual no longer carries the Angelic Runeblade, Azurewrath, he may still possess great strength and power within his new form.",
			"Also, he may not be able to tell friend from foe while in his present state. If you find him, he will almost certainly be hostile.",
			"Proceed with the utmost caution.",

			"Izual helped Diablo and his Brothers trick me into using the Soulstones against them... Now the Stones' powers are corrupted.",
			"With the combined powers of the Soulstones under their control, the Prime Evils will be able to turn the mortal world into a permanent outpost of Hell!",
			"The time has come to hunt down and destroy Diablo, himself.",
			"But beware, the Lord of Terror is not to be underestimated. He single-handedly destroyed the town of Tristram and corrupted the last noble hero who tried to stop him.",
			"This time, you must defeat him for good. Only by destroying the Soulstone which he carries will his spirit be banished forever.",
			"Good luck! Though this be our darkest hour, it may yet be your greatest moment.",

			"You've done well, hero. For now, you should rejoice.",
			"However, while you were fighting here, Baal remained behind in the mortal realm, building an army of hellish minions. Now, Baal's army is searching for the Worldstone, the ancient source of all the Soulstones and their power, while leaving behind a wake of destruction. They have forged deeply into the Barbarian homelands, heading directly for the summit of Mount Arreat!",
			"Baal knows, mortal hero! That is the very site of the blessed Worldstone!",
			"Now, enter the portal I have opened for you. It will take you to the Barbarian city of Harrogath, the last bastion of Order on the slopes of Arreat.",
			"Long ago, I swore an oath to watch over the Horadrim and their descendants.",
			"As Deckard Cain is the last of their esteemed Order, I will not allow him to perish here so far from the lands of his birth.",
			"Be at ease, hero, I know that he is your friend. He shall come to no harm.",
			"I am impressed, mortal. You have overcome the greatest challenge this world has ever faced and defeated the last of the Prime Evils. However, we are too late to save the Worldstone. Baal's destructive touch has corrupted it completely. ",
			"Given enough time, the Worldstone's energies will drain away and the barriers between the worlds will shatter -- the powers of Hell will flood into this...Sanctuary...and eradicate your people and everything you've labored to build. ",
			"Therefore, I must destroy the corrupted Worldstone before the powers of Hell take root. This act will change your world forever -- with consequences even I cannot foresee. However, it is the only way to ensure mankind's survival. ",
			"Go now, mortal. I have opened a portal that will lead you to safety. ",
			"May the Eternal Light shine upon you and your descendants for what you've done this day. The continued survival of mankind is your legacy! Above all else, you have earned a rest from this endless battle.",
			"Hope remains within the hearts of men.",
			"STOP! he beast contained herein shall not be set free--not even by you!",
			"Fool! You have just ensured the doom of this world. You cannot even begin to imagine what you've set in motion this day. Go now, to the Temple of Light in the eastern city of Kurast. There you will find the gate to Hell open before you. You must find the courage to step through that gate, Marius. Take the stone you hold to the Hellforge, where it will be destroyed. Go now! Take the stone and run!"

			"You see, our ancient Sisterhood has fallen under a strange curse. The mighty Citadel from which we have guarded the gates to the East for generations, has been corrupted by the evil Demoness, Andariel.",
			"I still can't believe it... but she turned many of our sister Rogues against us and drove us from our ancestral home. Now the last defenders of the Sisterhood are either dead or scattered throughout the wilderness.",
			"I implore you, stranger: please help us. Find a way to lift this terrible curse and we will pledge our loyalty to you for all time.",
			"I understand that Cain is the last descendant of the ancient Horadrim and that his knowledge of their lore is vast. He could prove to be very useful in discerning the nature of our current crisis.",
			"Kashya has always been fiercely loyal, but I fear her anger and frustration over these recent events will lead her into harm's way. She is highly protective of the few Rogues remaining under her command and will not send them into combat unless there is dire need.",
			"Charsi is young and innocent. However, I believe her Barbarian blood thrills to the prospect of adventure and danger. She takes great pride in her work and finds comfort in the fact that her weapons and armor are helping to end this evil plague.",
			"Though he has only been our guest for a short time, I sense that Warriv has faced many harrowing trials. Though he knows, as I do, that a terrible evil has blanketed the land, his only real concern is to reach the eastern trading ports with his caravan.",
			"To be honest, I have done my best to stay clear of Gheed. He wears dishonesty about himself like a cloak and seeks only to better his situation by preying on the misfortunes of others.",
			"The wilderness is overrun with Evil and the minions of Hell have taken our rightful home. We must purge all Evil from the Monastery and restore order to the world.",
			"I often dream of the day we reclaim our own. The Sightless Eye sees through the mist of time a great glory ahead, but how far ahead the Eye cannot discern.",
			"Our mental discipline is matched only by our skill in archery... I only hope these are enough to withstand this awful trial.",
			"Beware that you do not suffer the fate of the corrupted Rogues. To lose one's life is a tragedy, but to lose one's soul is even worse.",
			"Even though the corrupted ones were once of our Order, you need not shy from slaying them, for they stand between you and Andariel. Perhaps, when the Demon Queen is dead, our Sisters will return to life, but more likely they will be forever bound to their unholy pact.",
			"The Sisterhood of the Sightless Eye has a long and distinguished history. Over the generations our Order has become a deadly fighting force as well as a bastion for women who sought to forge their own destiny.",

			"Tristram is too far to journey by foot... Cain would likely be dead when you arrived. However, there is a magical portal that will take you there instantly.",
			"To open it, one must stand within the circle of Cairn Stones and touch them in a certain order. The proper order can be found in the runes written on the bark of the Tree of Inifuss.",

			"If he still lives, Deckard Cain may be in grave peril! You must hurry to Tristram before all is lost!",
			"You have risked your life to rescue Cain. For that we thank you. We must seek his counsel immediately.",
			"The dangers there are not solely architectural. Once inside that wretched place, many succumb to a vile miasma.",
			"There is no more I can tell you about that ancient tower.",
			"I thought the stories of treasure in the tower were nothing but lies. I am glad you found something of value in that death-trap. Would that our Sisters had been so fortunate.",
			"You must find the Malus.",
			"If you can't carry out this quest, how will you face the greater evils ahead?",
			"Well done, my friend. But remember, the return of the Horadric Malus is but one step in reclaiming the Monastery.",
			"Andariel has desecrated all we hold dear. She must not be permitted to serve Diablo. Destroy her! Her corruption of our Order must be undone!",
			"You have done much to help us, but I sense that this has only fueled Andariel's fury. She will not stop until we are all dead. You must kill Andariel before her army can gain the upper hand.",
			"Finally, we may rejoice! We owe you a debt we can never repay. I only hope that in time we will be able to rebuild our Order. All our thanks go with you, my friend."

From my studies, I have deduced that it is Radament the Fallen, an ancient Horadric mummy that has for some reason left his tomb to prey on mortals. I'm doing some more research now. If you check back later, I may have some more insight as to his nature.",
			"I've just been reading something interesting about this sort of undead. Apparently, certain Horadric funereal priests altered the bodies of their dead mages with magical and surgical techniques -- often replacing body parts with those of animals. This was thought to augment their powers, and raise their status in the afterlife.",
			"From what you tell me, it would seem that Radament was bent on the task of reviving his own mummified corpse with the flesh of the living. This is very unusual indeed. It takes an incredible magic power to alter the singular purpose of an undead mind. Perhaps there is a power at work here which is beyond my ken.",

			"When I spoke of this with Lord Jerhyn, he asked that I send you to him. Perhaps he knows of a secret entrance or the like.",

			"Though a powerful Summoner, Horazon feared that the Lords of Hell would punish him for enslaving their brethren. Thus, the Summoner created for himself an Arcane Sanctuary.",
			"He believed that his Sanctuary would not only protect him from Hell's vengeance, but also allow him to continue his studies free from the ravages of time and disease.",
			"Horazon had crafted many wondrous scrying devices through which he observed the events of the world outside. It is certain that he took careful study of Tal Rasha's imprisonment and recorded the location of his forgotten Tomb.",
			"The Arcane Sanctuary was believed to have been constructed here in Lut Gholein. An entrance may be hidden somewhere in the palace, as that building is very old, and was once a Vizjerei fortress.",
			"I am certain that you will find the information you need when you find Horazon's Journal. I suggest you find it quickly, for Diablo may be getting closer to freeing his brother as we speak.",
			"You have found Horazon's Journal. Excellent... But, I must caution you. The mark of the True Tomb of Tal Rasha, is sought, if not already known, by Diablo. I needn't elaborate on the implications of that.",
			"Yes... The man you speak of sounds like the mage who came here many months ago. He claimed to have fought Diablo in the passages beneath Tristram. No doubt the fool wandered into Horazon's Sanctuary and lost whatever was left of his ravaged mind. He is beyond salvation.",
			"It is possible that the fool has been possessed by the spirit of Horazon. If that's true, then you'd better put an end to his tortured existence. Once done, I believe the demons who were summoned and imprisoned within the Sanctuary will cease to exist as well.",

			"This is a serious setback... It is most unfortunate that Tal Rasha has been consumed by Baal's destructive influence. There are many secrets known to the Horadrim, which could be used by Baal against us.",
			"You must travel east by sea to Kurast and stop Diablo and Baal before they free their eldest brother, Mephisto. Hahh... The lands of the eastern Empire are not the same as they used to be. There has been little word for some time. Speed is of the essence. Go quickly, my friend. May the fates smile on you.",

We're not cheap, but we're the best this wasteland has to offer.",
			"We do a good job in town, but beyond the city gates, you'll find all manner of demons.",
			"The local guards were all relocated to the palace after the troubles began. No one really knows why. Actually, all of the town's brothel girls have been hiding out in the palace's cellar lately, so I assume that the guards have been assigned to 'protect them' with their lives.",

			"Geglash is an imposing warrior, but he's never been able to back down from a fight. One of these days, his pride will be the death of him.",
			"Meshif has sailed all around the southern seas and visited many strange lands. It must be driving him mad, having to stay anchored here.",
			"I haven't talked much to Fara. She keeps to herself most of the time. I get the feeling that she doesn't like us mercenary types much.",
			"I'd stay clear of Lysander, if I were you. He's always mixing his damned potions and chemicals. I wouldn't be surprised if he winds up blowing himself to smithereens!",
			"Drognan's a mystery to me. Then again, I never did trust mages much.",
			"I've personally found some of that devil's victims washed up out of the sewer. Often, they are missing limbs or a head, and their bodies have always been skinned. At first the creature raided the town at night... That's how Atma lost her family. Now we've got him barricaded in the sewers. You're safe up here on the surface, but every now and again some fool wants to be a hero and heads down to the waste tunnels with a pig-sticker. [chuckles lowly]",
			"We've been meaning to send an organized group down there to kill that thing, but it would be dangerous. We just can't afford the chance of losing any men with all the trouble that's going on in the desert.",
			"You've killed Radament, eh? That's quite a nice piece of work! If you ever need a job as a mercenary, I'd be happy to sign ya' up.",
			"This midday darkness reeks of foul magic! My men and I are trying to keep the peace, but this kind of thing really scares people.",

			"That guy really talks like that? Sounds like either Horazon has gone stir-crazy or that's some impostor.",
			"So, Horazon's been dead for some time. I take it you at least found what you were looking for.",
			"If you're going into the deep desert, why not hire a few of my men to watch your back?",

However, even though Bannuk could never admit it to me, as he grew older, I could see the same desire in his eyes. Oh... it's a pity I didn't encourage him to go with you. He might still be alive today.",

Anya, the young alchemist and daughter to one of our slain elders, has been missing for some time. She is a strong crafty woman, with a spirit like no other. One night, just before your arrival, I overheard her and Nihlathak arguing about her father's death.",
			"The next morning, she was gone. Nihlathak has his own tale as to where she went and why. Don't believe him! I fear he's at the root of her disappearance. Please if you can, search for Anya and bring her back to us. She'll know what to do about Nihlathak.",

			"Thank you so much for bringing Anya back to us. I have devised this spell to increase your resistances as a token of my thanks. I know it isn't much, but I hope you find it helpful. Please go talk to Anya. She has urgent news concerning Nihlathak.",
			"My worst fear has come true Nihlathak has gone mad. You must stop him, before he gives the Relic to the Lord of Destruction.",
			"Nihlathak was never the kindest man, but for him to betray the whole world. Where shall his soul finally rest?",
			"So, the Relic is lost. Do not dwell on failures past. It is your future that matters more.",
			"By reaching the Summit, just ceased being just a simple warrior. When you come back, you will be far more.",
			"Do not doubt yourself, I believe you're worthy to pass through the Ancient's gates. But you must believe as well.",

			"A Druid in Harrogath! Have things truly come to this? After the Mage Wars, I assumed Druids would never be seen around here again. You take a great risk coming here! To be honest, I have never been in comfort with your shape-shifting kind, but I do respect your search for balance and peace. So, if you trust us enough to let you enter our gates, then I trust you enough to let you stay.",

The strength of these scrolls lies in the ability of either apprentice or adept to cast them with equal ability. Their weakness is that they must first be read aloud and can never be kept at the ready in your mind. Know also that these scrolls can be read but once, so use them with care.",

For many spells, ensorcelled Staves may be charged with magical energies many times over. I have the ability to restore their power - but know that nothing is done without a price.",

		"The higher you place your faith in one man, the farther it has to fall. Farnham has lost his soul, but not to any demon. It was lost when he saw his fellow townspeople betrayed by the Archbishop Lazarus. He has knowledge to be gleaned, but you must separate fact from fantasy.",
		"The hand, the heart and the mind can perform miracles when they are in perfect harmony. The healer Pepin sees into the body in a way that even I cannot. His ability to restore the sick and injured is magnified by his understanding of the creation of elixirs and potions. He is as great an ally as you have in Tristram.",

His secretive dealings with the urchins and unspoken guilds of nearby towns gain him access to many devices that cannot be easily found in Tristram. While his methods may be reproachful, Wirt can provide assistance for your battle against the encroaching Darkness.",
		"Earthen walls and thatched canopy do not create a home. The innkeeper Ogden serves more of a purpose in this town than many understand.

His tavern, and the simple pleasures that can still be found there, provide a glimpse of a life that the people here remember. It is that memory that continues to feed their hopes for your success."

			"And the evil from my dreams followed me in my heels! How had he found me here? How could this broken shell of a man, barely able to carry the weight of his own sword, be the burning terror which drove me to hide here?",

			"However, the dreams returned. But these were clearly not my own. I beheld a vision of a great man: the mage, Tal Rasha. You were there too, Tyrael; I remember seeing you in my dream. His brethren had cornered a great demon named Baal, Lord of Destruction, who had been set loose upon the world.",
			"They attempted to imprison the demon within a sacred stone. Yet when their attempts failed, Tal Rasha selflessly volunteered to contain the demon within himself, completing the prison. He instructed his brethren to bind him within a tomb, buried under the sand... and there, to wrestle with the demon for all eternity.",
			"The next morning, we walked over the hill toward Lut Gholein. I had no idea then of the horrors that were in store for me there...",
			"My companion drew in the dank, cold air of the tomb. It seemed to... strengthen him. I stood in the doorway between light and darkness. What was left of my sanity implored me not to enter. But that voice was just a whisper now...",
			"As we worked our way deeper and deeper into the crypt, I began to see a change in my companion. He seemed to be gaining strength! I could barely see in the gloom, but my companion seemed to know the way. We came at last to a great hall. It was then I realized my companion hadn't been gaining strength; he had been losing what was left of his humanity.",
			"What choice did I have? I ran.",
			"I did as you told me, Tyrael: I found the temple of the Zakarum. In the deepest recesses of the temple, I found a dark gathering: my companion, the Wanderer; Tal Rasha; and a great evil who could only be the Lord of Hatred himself: Mephisto!",
			"I heard later that he was defeated, and that the Soulstones were destroyed in Hellforge. All except one...",
			"Oh, ho ho ho, oh I failed, Tyrael. I couldn't do as you asked. I couldn't enter that gate. Forgive me, Tyrael... forgive me.",
			"Take it! Take it, take it! I'm glad this is finally over, Tyrael! Look! What the stone has done to me, oh! Ho, ho, ho...",

What is the soulstone doing to me? Azmodan must die soon... Then I will be myself again.",

			"I'm not sure what I expected it would be like to have my mother back... but it wasn't this. She's different than what I imagined... I can see the toll her mission has exacted from her, just as it had with my uncle.",
			"I'm told he was a great warrior who was lost when Tristram fell to the demons.",
			"(Calming frightened citizens—urgent but not longer worried for them) You'll be safe down here!",
			"(Frustrated, between battles) How many monsters will he throw at us?",
			"I-I feel so weak. I-I don't know if I can.",
			"Let's go!",
			"(Urgent—called out 10 feet) Quick, into the sewers!",
			"(Urgent—called out 10 feet to frightened citizens) Down here! We'll protect you!",
			"(Urgent—called out 10 feet to frightened citizens) It's safe down in the sewers!",
			"(Urgent—called out 10 feet to frightened citizens) Over here, quickly!",
			"(Urgent—called out 10 feet to frightented citizens) Hurry! We'll keep you safe!",
			"(Insulting) That's not exploration; it's a rescue mission.",
			"(Desperate, worried—not too extreme on the emotion here) We're too late!",
			"Don't run off! You'll get yourself killed!",
			"I hear something coming...",
			"I'm going back to Tristram to check on Uncle Deckard.",
			"(Irritated) Please don't.",
			"I studied these battles in Cain's books... but seeing them is much worse.",
			"It is such an open and beautiful city. It thrives on trade and new ideas. There was always something new and exciting to hear or see.",
			"It's only happened a few times in my life, and only when I was in grave danger. Something rises up from deep within me... and, well, I can't really explain it.",
			"It's strange, sometimes I have these vivid dreams. ",
			"I used to love traveling, seeing the world.",
			"I've got a bad feeling about this.",
			"I've got your back!",
			"I've spent most of my life traveling from place to place with Uncle Deckard while he did his crazy research.",
			"I've spent years exploring places like this with Uncle Deckard. This brings back memories.",
			"I will stay here and prepare the ritual. Be careful!",
			"I wonder who killed these soldiers...",
			"Killing Urzel didn't stop the ritual. ",
			"((Laughs ruefully) ) Yes, it's not like it was.",
			"Let me go!",
			"Look—a hidden cellar! Follow me!",
			"Look at this architecture! This predates the Sin War!",
			"Maybe Adria is right about the Black Soulstone.",
			"(modest) Oh, I wouldn't say that.",
			"No!",
			"No one is getting ambushed in my inn!",
			"No. There have been no nephalem for a millennium. ",
			"Not today, monster!",
			"(Not too angry, slightly exasperated) Horrors have visited Tristram before, and it endured.",
			"(Not too over the top or called out - determined, through gritted teeth) Stand back! I still can't fully control it.",
			"(Not too soft, speaking from experience) I don't know why. Power can be a terrible burden.",
			"(Not too wistful or thoughtful, driven to know how people can be evil) Why do you think the Coven does what it does? What drives people to evil?",
			"(Not unkind, correcting.  ) I was talking about happy memories.",
			"((Offended)) Do you think I'm not holding my own?",
			"(Offended) What? You're not really thinking of reading my journal, are you?",
			"Oh.",
			"Oh no you don't!",
			"But I am more than I once was. The seven Evils are now one within me.",
			"I am... the Prime Evil!",
			"(Leah turning into diablo ) I LIVE! ",
			"Now, at last, to my true goal, the one that has always eluded me: the utter destruction of the High Heavens!",
			"Well done, faithful Adria. Go now until I call upon you again. ",
			"Please, Uncle, not more of your stories. All that matters now is that you're back.",
			"According to the Horadric texts, only two Evils remain. Belial is here in Caldeum, and Azmodan has yet to reveal himself. ",
			"(Amused) Maybe. But they've got to have books on the Black Soulstone and Azmodan. Something that will help me understand his theories.",
			"And where defeat would break our will to resist.",
			"(Angry.) Why? Why would you keep all this knowledge hidden away?",
			"(Called out, taunting the enemy) Is that all?",
			"(Called out—urgent on the way to battle. Called out 6-8 feet) Belial has started his attack on the city! Let's go. Asheara is already at the sewers!",
			"(dazed, she was just hit by a spell she was casting - but not too young and weepy - she's still the tough and determined Leah) Yes... I think so.",
			"(Determined) I know.",
			"(emphasis on our, suspicious of Kulle) We're ready to do our part. Just you remember yours.",
			"(Fond) I can't tell you how many times I had to drag him away from an army of skeletons because he was fixated on some dusty old tapestry.",
			"(Fond) I understand it better now. If I don't copy out these runes before they fade away completely, who will?",
			"((gasps, she just miscast a spell)) This is difficult!",
			"He's... gone now. ",
			"(hopeful, eager to please - but still our tough Leah) You think so? ",
			"I can't believe Belial's been here so long and no one has tried to stop him!",
			"I don't have an accent!",
			"I'll meet you when you get to the archives.",
			"I mean, where will he strike?",
			"I'm going to go with you.",
			"I'm going to the waypoint and back to camp.",
			"I miss searching for lost artifacts with Uncle Deckard—even though it did have its dangerous side.",
			"I needed her help back in New Tristram. ",
			"I needed his help back in New Tristram. ",
			"I saw people hiding under the carts. Bring them to the sewers!",
			"It's Belial. So long as he lives, all of Caldeum is under siege.",
			"I've read this passage over and over, but it just doesn't make any sense. Uncle Deckard's ciphers aren't revealing anything for it.",
			"I want more time to explore the Great Library of Caldeum when this is all over.",
			"Lead the rest of the people here before it's too late!",
			"Looks like I got here just in time. Emperor Hakan? What are you doing here?",
			"Many are. Fear drives them to it.",
			"My mother says that if I use it for good, then it's a blessing.  The thing is, it only rises when I'm scared... or angry. ",
			"(Pained) This is the terrible magic... my mother warned me about. I can feel it calling to me—tearing at my soul. It cries out for release!",
			"(perplexed) Do you know where Azmodan could be?",
			"(quietly) Thanks.",
			"(Relieved after battle—a little playful) Belial must really want you.",
			"(sadly about cain) Here we are: Caldeum, Jewel of the East. Uncle Deckard loved this place...",
			"(she just got hit by a spell she was trying to cast; pained) Agh!",
			"(Slightly projected, determined, not sentimental) That's why you left me... You went to mark the demons' souls, so that they could be drawn into Kulle's vessel!",
			"(slightly regretful) Uncle Deckard and I traveled a lot, so I never really got close to anyone.",
			"So before we face him, we must evacuate the citizens. The Iron Wolves can help.",
			"That passage should lead to the Desolate Sands.",
			"That's one lever down. ",
			"The guards were asking you about this... Black Soulstone. I remember reading about it in Uncle's journal, but it didn't seem important.",
			"The philosopher Kadus said, \"If you want to know the truth of a city, you need look no further than the state of its infrastructure.\"",
			"There are more people to the west, through the doors!",
			"The runes etched through this place are amazing. I can't wait to get back to camp and transcribe what I've seen.",
			"These archives are incredible. So much power, hidden away for centuries. ",
			"Time you squandered on your own twisted pursuits! ",
			"Uncle Deckard theorized that the demon lords leave demons in their wake, much like us leaving footprints.",
			"(unimpressed) I don't believe you.",
			"(urgent) We must get through Caldeum!",
			"Watch out! Keep the people away from those fireballs!",
			"Well, a little. But I still feel lucky.",
			"We should bring Kulle's head with us. Maybe he'll have something useful to say. I'll put him in your bag.",
			"We've got to reach the Emperor! He said he can lead us to Belial!",
			"What do all your books contain, Kulle? ",
			"When Belial's defeated, the people will finally see through this veil of deceit. ",
			"(worried) I don't know. It doesn't feel natural to me.",
			"Yes. And built on secrets.",
			"Yes! He was a renegade Horadrim, dismembered by his brethren before he could activate the soulstone. His head was sealed away in the Dahlgur Oasis.",
			"Yes. The more I study my uncle's books, the more I realize that even I took his wisdom for granted.",
			"You go on ahead. I'm going to go back to town. I need to learn the spell needed to restore Kulle's body.",
			"(Relieved and victorious) It's done!",
			"(Relieved) The soulstone seems stable now.",
			"(Resigned—hopeless) No, you were right. There is no safe place for anyone. Look around us. If this keep can't protect us, what chance would a silly little inn have?",
			"<cries>",
			"(growls; Leah powering up with crazy black energy she can't control—terrifying sounds for those who know her) Hrrrrrrgh, aaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!",
			"He never gave up on me, though. He was a great man.",
			"If only I could control this... power. I could have saved him.",
			"(Leah hulking-out, crazy black energy coming from deep inside her. Let's record a bunch and let the audio team piece it together) Uncle!",
			"Maghda... and her master, Belial. The journal speaks of \"an angel falling from the Heavens as the shadow rises from the Abyss.\" The Stranger is the key to all of this! ",
			"(Sad, but not too sad - she's as angry at the situation as she is sad) This damned power I have... Uncle Deckard said it came from my mother. He tried to teach me how to control it, using his Horadric training, but it never really helped.",
			"Uncle Deckard!!!",
			"(Weakened, on her knees—frightened by the crazy power she just unleashed) Uncle!",
			"When my power... erupted, I saw into Maghda's mind for an instant. She's fled to the Highlands. You can reach them through the caves above Wortham. You have to know she'll be waiting for you.",
			"You can't die...",
			"You should follow Kulle into his sanctum before he changes his mind.",
			"(sad, grieving) Caldeum—everything Uncle Deckard left me leads to this place. It's strange; I first met him here when I was only a child... and now his loss feels heavier than ever. He was right about everything all along... We have to stop Belial before it's too late.",
			"(Sad sort of \"thank-you\" then on to other things.) Thank you... I'm going to get back to my research.",
			"(Screaming, in pain) The stone is vibrating... I can barely hold it. Their voices—they're screaming in my head! ",
			"(serious & reflective) These fields used to be so beautiful. Uncle Deckard told me stories of them when I was a little girl.",
			"(A little depressed) It hasn't been easy for me lately.",
			"(a little depressed) I was afraid you'd say that.",
			"(Amused) So I'm your elder, then?",
			"(Called out—she's interrupting from 20 feet away) Leave her alone!",
			"(Determined) She must have had a good reason, right?",
			"(Don't lose Leah's toughness) Even though I haven't been here for years, I'll always think of Caldeum as home.",
			"(emphasis on \"you\") I'm not! I'm just disinterested in you.",
			"I don't think about that sort of thing.",
			"I found my mother, Adria! She's alive, but the Imperial Guard is holding her somewhere down here!",
			"I'll never forget the fights I used to get in when I was a child.",
			"I played in these sewers when I was a child.",
			"I used to get so upset when Uncle Deckard would go on and on about angels and demons. Now I would give anything to hear him tell his tales again. ",
			"(Matter of fact) I am twenty. And you?",
			"(Not too light - this is serious stuff) Do you ever think about what Alaric said—that you are nephalem?",
			"(Not too sad, don't soften until the end) It's more than that. This is where I first met Uncle Deckard. I really miss him.",
			"Of course. It's the most exciting way to get around the city when you're seven.",
			"(Serious, important) I think he might have been right. There is something... special about you.",
			"(Serious, not too wistful) Why do you think my mother never let us know she was alive?",
			"(Sighs) What is it?",
			"So Maghda was telling the truth. Somehow, I knew my mother was alive... I always knew it. ",
			"(Suspicious) Thanks. You're not going to steal it, are you?",
			"The other children thought I was strange. They tormented me mercilessly.",
			"This way is the entrance to the Caldeum bazaar.",
			"(Urgent but not yelled—projected about 10 feet) Adria should be up here.",
			"Was it difficult for you, learning the art of sorcery?",
			"You know who I am?",
			"(She is disturbed by this - the woman she thinks of as her mother was one of those who went mad.) I don't know what really happened here, but whatever it was, it was horrible. Nearly everyone who survived went mad.",
			"(She's starting to wonder about whether her mom was a witch, now, with what she's seeing) People said she was a witch, but I never believed it.",
			"She was in search of something, but I am not sure what. She reminds me of Uncle Deckard, obsessed with the war between angels and demons.",
			"She wasn't from Tristram originally. She came here during the troubles. ",
			"Shouldn't we be going?",
			"Sometimes I wonder...",
			"(Surprised, worried—sees he's turned into a zombie—a little called out) Captain Daltyn?!",
			"Templar, I think I saw you at an inn several months ago.",
			"Thank you both for your help.",
			"Thank you. Now we need to go to the sewers. I'll explain why when we get there.",
			"Thank you. You should speak with Captain Rumford at the gate. He can tell you what to do.",
			"That last skeleton must have been one of Alaric's people. But it didn't stop him from attacking.",
			"That makes me think of the Drowned Temple near the Festering Woods. I remember you telling me about it, Uncle. ",
			"That must be Wortham! ",
			"That's all of them.",
			"That's why I want to make one.",
			"The auras and the dark cultists are gone! They have paid for those who died at their hands.",
			"The auras have weakened even more! We must make them pay for destroying the chapel and all the villagers inside.",
			"The Black Soulstone's getting hotter, straining against me. They're... whispering to me from inside.",
			"The chapel is almost destroyed.  The people will be killed!",
			"The dead will overwhelm us all unless something is done.",
			"The death of their leaders is weakening the ritual. If we can hold out and kill one more, we break the spell!",
			"The defenses of the keep will not hold. The soldiers are scattered, fleeing from Azmodan's army.",
			"The Drowned Temple was once known as the Sarceum Emporis. It was the most sacred of their temples, a site where legend claims angels would come to impart their wisdom to the nephalem.",
			"The goatmen are rampaging through the fields. Could the sword have anything to do with that?",
			"The nephalem were ancient humans with fantastic powers. Legend holds that they waged a terrible battle near the temple and that their ghosts still war with one another.",
			"Then let me begin the ritual... but I'm warning you, Kulle, you'd better not cross us!",
			"The people in the chapel need my help! I'm going on ahead!",
			"There are so many burdens in life. We all need help sometimes.",
			"They won't get us!",
			"This fight was too easy. She's toying with us. We must get back to Uncle Deckard right away.",
			"This is about as exciting as the time Uncle Deckard and I spent the summer in Bramwell. People are quite boring there.",
			"This is amazing! It reminds me of being a child and searching for lost artifacts with Uncle Deckard.",
			"This is just like target practice!",
			"This is my room. Do you like it?",
			"This is where Diablo drove old King Leoric mad and terrorized the people.",
			"This will lead you to the royal crypts below the cathedral. I'm going to get this tome back to uncle Deckard.",
			"This world is so dangerous. Everybody needs a quiet, safe place to rest and recover. A waystation on their journeys.",
			"(Thought of Skeleton King fills her with steely determination, resolve) Uncle Deckard is home—rescued from the clutches of the Skeleton King! I'm so glad. But the Skeleton King? I thought he was a folktale. The idea of Mad King Leoric returning to torture this place... Hasn't Tristram suffered enough?",
			"(Tired/scared) I'm glad this is almost done. I don't... I don't think I have much time left.",
			"(tired, worried) We've reached Bastion's Keep, but holding the Black Soulstone together takes up all of my time now. Sometimes I think of the wounded soldiers and their families outside... but then my concentration fails and the spells weaken. I must stay focused and trust my friend to save the keep and its people.",
			"(Tough and determined - concerned about her mother) We have the Black Soulstone at last, despite Zoltun Kulle's betrayal. I always knew he couldn't be trusted. Fortunately, we were able to defeat him and retrieve the stone. I learned that my mother had secretly bound the fallen Lords of Hell to it... I just wonder why she didn't tell me.",
			"(trying to be nice) Well, you are a little exotic to them.",
			"(Unbelieving) He's convinced that the forces of Hell will invade our world and bring about the end times. All these years, he's still searching for a way to stop this... apocalypse.",
			"Uncle Deckard and I traveled all over the world in my youth, looking for lost lore and artifacts. It was so exciting—crawling around ancient temples, digging through forgotten crypts... ",
			"Uncle Deckard believes that the madness and horror of her life finally caught up with her. ",
			"Uncle Deckard called these flying creatures \"death with wings.\"",
			"Uncle Deckard is gone forever. I remember the wonderful times we had together, always off on another crazy quest. What will I do without him? He believed the Stranger was an angel, but he is only a man. I always knew they were just stories. Uncle Deckard died for those stories.",
			"Uncle Deckard, they sound like those dark cultists you told me about.",
			"Uncle! You're alive!",
			"(Warning) Stay back. ",
			"Watch out, the wounded are turning!",
			"(Weak.) The demonic rage is building up again. But I can do this.  I know I can. Thank you.",
			"(Weary, but not listless - needs the feel of being driven to the edge of her ability to cope) The days are hard. If it weren't for my mother standing beside me, I don't know what I'd do. She even watches the stone for a few hours each night so I can rest. Sometimes I dream I'm in New Tristram with Uncle Deckard again, and... it's hard to wake up after that.",
			"We did it! The auras and the dark cultists are gone! We saved the town.",
			"We finished them off!",
			"Well, details are hazy, but I know that Adria was obsessed with chasing the arcane. She knew she could never raise a child.",
			"Well, if you ever want a job, I will consider your credentials.",
			"We'll need to open the cathedral first. The guards locked it up before they were ambushed. Rumford told me they fought their way back to Adria's hut. The key must still be there.",
			"We need to give them a sign. Something to rally the defenders.",
			"We've been under siege for six days now. Uncle Deckard is still missing. Captain Rumford and the others are losing hope. I tell them not to lose faith... but if help doesn't arrive soon...",
			"We won!",
			"What?",
			"What are we doing in my room?",
			"What did she mean my mother will share my fate? Could my mother be alive after all these years?",
			"What the tomes say of Alaric and this temple is not encouraging.",
			"When this is over, I could open my own little inn somewhere. If I live.",
			"When we retrieved the Stranger's second sword piece, Maghda found us. She's always on our heels. Who is she? She claims to know my mother, but how could that be? Regardless, we must beat her to Wortham and the final piece of the sword.",
			"Why do they still fight?",
			"Yes, you've been telling me about the texts since I was eight years old, Uncle. I just don't think we should read too much into them.",
			"You mean how did she die? ",
			"You must be Alaric the guardian... Uncle Deckard told me of your eternal watch over this cursed place. I thought it was a myth!",
			"Your companions have found Adria's cellar. I'm going ahead to meet them.",
			"Your friend's reached the gate in Old Tristram. I'll run ahead to open it for them."
